# GB Snake

## Description
This is a clone of the classic snake game using GBDK.

There are 4 levels, with some levels having objects in the play area that the player needs to avoid. Each level is beaten after the snake reaches its maximum size and 
the player grabs the key. Another change to the classic
game is that the food is on a timer and if the player 
takes to long to reach it, it will respawn at a different
location.

All sprites, backgrounds, and music are original art.

## Controls
- D-pad: Move the snake
- START: Pause the game
